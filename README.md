# Web Development Lab 3 - Coffee Wordle Game

Submitted by: Peyton Adkins

This web app imitates the popular game Wordle in a loose sense in that a coffee order is displayed on the screen and the user must figure out which specifications of the four categories would go into making the drink. 

Time spent: 4 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] **One drink at a time is displayed**
- [X] **The user can click one option for each of the four categories to input their answer**
- [X] **The selected option populates into the box above, and if an option is already in the box, it is replaced by the new option**
- [X] **Clicking “check answer” submits the answer to be checked for correctness**
- [X] **After clicking “check answer”, the user can see which components of a drink they entered correctly and incorrectly by having the box for that answer change visually**
- [X] **Clicking on the new drink button shows a new drink and clears the input boxes**

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [X] Cat

## Notes

I didn't face any direct issues in this lab. Though, I believe what I will need to apply to for HW3 is part of the stretch features of this lab, which I didn't follow through with.
